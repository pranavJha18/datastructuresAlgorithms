# What is a good code?

1. Readable
2. Scalable --> BIG O gives us idea about scalability of a software

> [!NOTE]
> O(n):-> means that it has a linear time complexity.... if we increase the number of elements then the number of operations will increase proportionally to it.
> O(1):-> Constant time.... no matter how much we increase the number of elements the number of operations will remain the same
